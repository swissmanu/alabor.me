Repository for [alabor.me](http://alabor.me), my personal internet page.

## Technologies
* HTML sources are generated using [wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith), a static page generator written in JavaScript.
* Stylesheets are preprocessed using [node-sass](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass) or more specifically by its wintersmith counterpart [wintersmith-sass](https://github.com/imothee/wintersmith-sass/)
* Publishing to the live server is accomplished by a process initially introduced in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/swissmanu/5629414) by myself
* Everything is automated with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
